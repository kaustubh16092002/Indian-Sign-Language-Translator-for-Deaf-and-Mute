### Phase 1
- This phase is designed for speech to text conversion.
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/project-idea-audio-sign-language-translator/
- Inspired by the [implementation of Satyam](https://github.com/satyam9090/Automatic-Indian-Sign-Language-Translator-ISL)
- Libraries such as NLTK, PyAudio were used for this phase.
### Phase 2
- This phase is designed for gesture to text conversion.
- Inspired by the [implementation of Rishab Guptha](https://github.com/imRishabhGupta/Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition)
- Inspired by the [implementation of Karthi Keyu](https://github.com/Karthikeyu/Indian-sign-language-recognition)
